# Custom writer

This is a sample custom writer for pandoc.  It produces output
that is very similar to that of pandoc's HTML writer.
There is one new feature: code blocks marked with class 'dot'
are piped through graphviz and images are included in the HTML
output using `data:` URLs.

Here's an example:

```dot
digraph G {
main -> parse -> execute;
main -> init;
main -> cleanup;
execute -> make_string;
execute -> printf
init -> make_string;
main -> printf;
execute -> compare;
}
```
