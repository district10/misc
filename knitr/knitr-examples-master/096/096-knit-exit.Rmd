We can exit a document early using the `knit_exit()` function.

Below is a simple chunk, and there is a time-consuming chunk after it.

```{r}
library(knitr)
1 + 1
knit_exit()
```

Okay, you will not see me in the output.

```{r}
Sys.sleep(100)
```

Normally you have to wait for 100 seconds, but since I have called
`knit_exit()`, the rest of the document is actually ignored.
