# SAS

As long as SAS is not in your `PATH` variable, you need to specify its full path with the `engine.path` option, e.g.

```{r hello-world, engine='sas', engine.path="C:\\Program Files\\SASHome\\x86\\SASFoundation\\9.3\\sas.exe", eval=FALSE}
data _null_;
%put 'Hello, world!';
run;
```

I do not have SAS installed on my system so I did not really run the code above (`eval=FALSE`).

I'm not familiar with SAS either; please feel free to improve the [`sas` engine](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/engine.R) in **knitr**.
