This demo shows you how to merge the source and output blocks in markdown output. Note **knitr** puts R source and output in separate blocks by default.

```{r test-a}
a = 1
a
b = 1:10
write(b, '')
```

See if the chunk option `collapse` works:

```{r test-b, ref.label='test-a', collapse=TRUE}
```

Source and output lived together happily ever in **knitr**.
